Capstone Project 1: Recipe Sharing API with Image Upload
Build a REST API for a recipe sharing platform where users can post recipes with images, search for
recipes by ingredients, and rate others' recipes. This is similar to apps like Tasty or AllRecipes. The API
should handle image uploads, process them (resize/compress), store recipe data, and provide search
functionality.
Deliverables
Complete REST API with proper project structure
Database schema/migrations
Postman/curl collection for testing all endpoints
README with API documentation and setup instructions
Capstone Project 3: Student Grade Management System API
Build a REST API for managing student grades similar to university portals like Canvas or Blackboard.
The system should support different user roles (students, teachers, admins), allow teachers to manage
courses and grades, and provide students with their academic performance data including GPA
calculation and grade statistics.
Deliverables
Complete REST API with proper structure
Database schema with relationships
Seed data script (sample users, courses, grades)
API documentation (Postman collection or OpenAPI spec)
README with role permissions matrix and setup guide
Capstone Project 4: Movie Watchlist & Recommendation API
Build a REST API that integrates with external movie databases (like OMDB or TMDB) to help users
manage their watchlists and get recommendations. Users can search for movies, add them to
watchlists, rate watched movies, and get personalized recommendations based on their ratings and
genres.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema for user data and cached movies
README with API documentation and external API setup
Document explaining your caching strategy
Capstone Project 5: Event Registration & Ticketing System
Build a REST API for event registration and ticketing (like Eventbrite). Users can browse events, register
for events with limited capacity, and organizers can create events and manage registrations. The critical
challenge is handling concurrent registrations to prevent overbooking when multiple users try to register
for the last few spots simultaneously.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema with proper constraints
Concurrent booking test (simulate multiple users booking last spot)
README with concurrency strategy explanation
Document explaining your approach to preventing race conditions
Capstone Project 6: Online Quiz Platform API
Build a REST API for an online quiz/exam platform (like Kahoot or Google Forms for exams). Teachers
create quizzes with time limits, students take timed quizzes, and the system auto-grades submissions.
The challenge is managing timed sessions accurately, preventing cheating (no peeking at answers), and
handling concurrent quiz attempts.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema for quizzes, questions, sessions, submissions
README with API documentation
Document explaining your timer implementation approach
Capstone Project 7: Expense Tracker with Bill Splitting API
Build a REST API for tracking shared expenses and splitting bills among friends (like Splitwise). Users
can create groups (roommates, trip groups), add expenses, and the system calculates who owes whom.
The challenge is implementing the settlement algorithm to minimize the number of transactions needed
to settle all debts.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema with proper decimal/money types
Settlement algorithm implementation with explanation
README with API documentation and algorithm explanation
Example scenarios showing settlement optimization
Document explaining your money handling approach
Capstone Project 8: Food Delivery Order Management API
Build a REST API for managing food delivery orders (like Uber Eats or DoorDash). Customers place
orders, restaurants accept and prepare them, and drivers deliver them. The system must handle order
lifecycle state transitions, real-time status updates, and coordinate between three user types. The
challenge is implementing a robust state machine and ensuring valid state transitions.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
State machine diagram showing all transitions
Database schema with order state tracking
README with API documentation and state machine explanation
Document explaining your approach to preventing invalid state transitions
Capstone Project 9: Workout & Fitness Tracker API
Build a REST API for tracking workouts and fitness progress (like Strava or MyFitnessPal). Users log
workouts, track personal records, view progress over time, and compete on leaderboards. The
challenge is handling time-series data efficiently, calculating streaks, computing aggregated statistics,
and managing user achievements.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema optimized for time-series queries
Streak calculation algorithm implementation
README with API documentation
Capstone Project 10: Library Book Management System API
Build a REST API for a library management system (like your college library portal). Librarians manage
books and inventory, students check out and return books, and the system handles reservations when
books are unavailable. The challenge is implementing the checkout/return workflow with reservations,
calculating fines for late returns, and managing the reservation queue.
Deliverables
Complete REST API
Database schema with book copies and checkout tracking
README with API documentation
Document explaining your reservation queue and concurrent checkout handling
